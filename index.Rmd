## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Write an introductory paragraph explaining the domain/data set (feel free to borrow from the project proposal)

# Write a summary paragraph that includes information calculated by your summary information function

# Render your table and describe pertinent observations found in it

# Describe the purpose of each chart (e.g., "this chart was intended to show the relationship between..."), render each chart, and describe pertinent observations found in each chart
